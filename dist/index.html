      <h1>ClearWater in Ecuador</h1>
      <p>ClearWater is bringing clean drinking water to indigenous communities in the Ecuadorian Amazon. By building rainwater catchment systems, ClearWater works with communities to provide viable clean water solutions.</p>

      <h1>The Nor-Oriente Amazon</h1>
      <p>The Amazon rainforest produces 20% of our water. In the Ecuadorian Amazon, the water sources are contaminated by 
decades of reckless oil operations and 30,000 peoples are suffering a health crisis due to the toxins in the water.
ClearWater is partnering with five indigenous tribes to directly address this crisis.</p>

      <p> 
      Centuries ago, the Cofán people moved down from the foothills of the Andes Mountains to inhabit a large territory in the northern Ecuadorian Amazon. The Cofán have been inspiring protagonists in the 19-year legal battle against the oil companies, yet they continue to suffer from the devastating contamination in their communities, most significantly the lack of clean water.

      <p>The Waorani were the most recently contacted of all Ecuadorian indigenous peoples. Since first contact in 1956, the Waorani have experienced a rapid and difficult insertion into mainstream Ecuadorian society. Their territories have been greatly reduced, and their remaining lands impacted by logging, oil extraction, and colonist settlement. Oil activity and the construction of oil roads has been severely detrimental to Waorani lands. </p>

      <p>Today, we travelled to the village of Rumipamba home of the Kichwa people. The mission is to observe firsthand the extent of oil contamination in the region and to inspect existing rainwater catchment systems in the area. Going in, we all have some preconceived notions about exactly what this looks like but are not prepared for what lies ahead of us. <a href="http://beta.giveclearwater.org/2012/08/engineers-borders-sjsu-ecuador-day-1/">Read The Full Blog Post</a></p>
