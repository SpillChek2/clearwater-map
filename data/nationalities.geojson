        "story_excerpt": "Centuries ago, the Cofan people moved down from the foothills of the Andes Mountains to inhabit a large territory in the northern Ecuadorian Amazon. The Cofan have been inspiring protagonists in the 19-year legal battle against the oil companies, yet they continue to suffer from the devastating contamination in their communities, most significantly the lack of clean water."

        "story_excerpt": "The Waorani were the most recently contacted of all Ecuadorian indigenous peoples. Since first contact in 1956, the Waorani have experienced a rapid and difficult insertion into mainstream Ecuadorian society. Their territories have been greatly reduced, and their remaining lands impacted by logging, oil extraction, and colonist settlement. Oil activity and the construction of oil roads has been severely detrimental to Waorani lands. "
