,,TRUE,Cofan,,"Centuries ago, the Cofan people moved down from the foothills of the Andes Mountains to inhabit a large territory in the northern Ecuadorian Amazon. The Cofan have been inspiring protagonists in the 19-year legal battle against the oil companies, yet they continue to suffer from the devastating contamination in their communities, most significantly the lack of clean water."
,,TRUE,Secoya,,"The Secoya suffer heavily from oil-related contamination. Rivers have been contaminated, making much of the water unsafe to drink or bathe in; traditional subsistence activities like hunting, fishing, and growing edible crops are at risk."
,#N/A,TRUE,Waorani,j,"The Waorani were the most recently contacted of all Ecuadorian indigenous peoples. Since first contact in 1956, the Waorani have experienced a rapid and difficult insertion into mainstream Ecuadorian society. Their territories have been greatly reduced, and their remaining lands impacted by logging, oil extraction, and colonist settlement. Oil activity and the construction of oil roads has been severely detrimental to Waorani lands. "
,,TRUE,Kichwa,,"The Kichwa of the Amazon are the most numerous of Ecuador’s indigenous Amazonian peoples and have taken cleaning up after the oil companies into their own hands. They have taken the environmental remediation into their own hands, painstakingly cleaning up the mess that the oil companies have left behind. "
,,TRUE,Siona,,"Like the Secoya, the Siona currently suffer from oil contamination, African palm production, deforestation, and expanding colonist settlement in their territory."
